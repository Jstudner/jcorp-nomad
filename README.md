## What is Nomad

Jcorp Nomad is an open-source offline media server built for travel, remote work, classrooms, camping, and more. It runs entirely on an ESP32-S3 dev board, creates a local Wi-Fi hotspot, and serves media through a browser-accessible interface. It does not require internet access and works similarly to in-flight entertainment systems.

This project is designed to be compact, simple, and easily modifiable. It includes optional 3D-printable hardware and a fully open source firmware and web interface.

## Features

- Creates a local Wi-Fi hotspot with captive portal  
- Serves HTML media interface to any connected device  
- Streams content directly from a FAT32-formatted microSD card  
- Supports simultaneous connections (tested with up to 4 video streams)  
- No app or internet connection required  
- Open source firmware and UI  
- Customizable web interface / Features

## Hardware Requirements

**Disclaimer:**  
The following links are Amazon affiliate links. Purchasing through these links supports this project at no additional cost to you. Thank you for your support!

- **Waveshare ESP32-S3 Dev Board (1.47" LCD version)**  
  [https://amzn.to/4ktB6oT](https://amzn.to/4ktB6oT)

- **FAT32-formatted microSD card (16 GB minimum recommended, 64 GB preferred)**  
  [https://amzn.to/44tM1c4](https://amzn.to/44tM1c4)

- **USB power source** (e.g., battery bank or computer)

- **Optional:** 3D-printed enclosure (STL files included in the repository)

---

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (to flash firmware)
- Python 3.x (to run `media.py`)
- SquareLine Studio (optional, for screen UI editing)

All software used is free and available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## Quick Start

1. Flash the ESP32-S3 with the firmware in the `/firmware/` directory.
2. Format your SD card as **FAT32** and copy the web files from `/SD_Card_Template/`.
3. Place your media files into the appropriate folders (see structure below).
4. Run `media.py` to generate `media.json` automatically.
5. Insert the SD card and power the device.
6. Connect to the Wi-Fi network named `NomadServer`.
7. Your browser will be redirected to the offline media interface.
